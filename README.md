# Anita - The (wikifeet.com) Picture Grabber #

Yes, _Anita_ is currently a tool to easily download pictures from [wikifeet.com]().
But the long term goal is, that _Anita_ should be a multipurpose picture grabber. (To know more about the planned features, you should continue reading. :wink:)

## Motivation ##

Why such a tool? Simply put: If you like to collect pics (like others collect stamps), you want hardly do it manually picture by picture. Especially, if you want to actualize your collection later.

I searched for browser extensions, which could do the job. They may be good for general batch downloads of pictures. But [wikifeet.com]() is a bit special in that form, that it only loads more pics on demand through [Ajax][1].

But here is _Anita_ and comes for rescue. :smile:
